<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I love solving real-life problems and coding in my free time. For each of the projects I built, I started by thinking about how I can improve this world and help someone to solve their worry. </p>
<p>In my previous <a href="https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo">SEO</a> roles, I was writing Python scripts to automate data gathering and data analysis. I also tried coding in my free time. This made me realise that my true passion is programming. However, it was difficult to make the decision about switching careers. The pandemic gave me a lot of free time and helped to put my life into perspective and make the move toward the career of my dreams.</p>
<p>I love coding because it helps solve problems and make our life easier. It also has almost endless possibilities. Another very exciting thing about programming is that it is constantly evolving and to be a good developer you need to always learn something new. I love learning new things and improving my skills, I'm sure I'll never get bored of coding! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>I love bugs and solving them - I get very excited about searching where they are coming from! I am a self-starter, a quick learner, and have a can-do attitude. I am self-organised, and self-motivated.</p>

<h2>Skills üßê</h2>

<h3>Great communicator</h3>
I have experience working with internal/external stakeholders and building strong relationships with them. In my previous roles as an SEO Manager, I was collaborating with internal teams daily to know their requirements and agree on new implementations. 

<h3>Inspiring Mentor</h3>
As a part of several of my previous roles, I was responsible for training and helping junior members of the team learn more. In my last role as an SEO Manager, I was in charge of a team of two, whom I was training, providing support in daily tasks & organising meetings where each of the members was doing a presentation on a given topic. This helped me inspire everyone in my team to keep learning and educating themselves.</br>
After I left my team to persuade my goals in a programming career, one of the juniors contacted me saying she misses me and that I was a good manager.

<h3>Fast Learner</h3>
For our final project at Makers, we decided to use a framework we were not familiar with at the time - Ruby on Rails. As we had only 2 weeks to build the project, I needed to learn how to build web apps with Rails in a matter of very short time. I started by reading the official documentation, along with watching video tutorials. After spending one day studying, I was comfortable to start building the app. As a result we  successfully built a fully functioning app - <a href="https://github.com/IrinaVi/SpotiFive">SpotiFive</a>.

<h3>Team player</h3>
I love working in a team and learning about people more through team projects. During the Makers Bootcamp, I was a part of three different teams. I always try to make sure I do my part not only from the coding perspective but also from a colleague's perspective: I want to make sure everyone is comfortable in the team. For example, in one of our projects, I noticed that one of the team members was very quiet and didn't participate much in the team meetings. I asked the team to make sure that everyone is following and that everyone's opinions matter and they should not be shy in expressing them. After that I noticed, that my team member started saying more - they knew, we need their opinion.
