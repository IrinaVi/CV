<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I love solving real life problems and coding in my free time. Each of my projects I started with thinking about how I can impove this world and help someone to solve their worry. </p>
<p>In my previous SEO roles I was writing Python scripts to automate data gathering and data analysis. I also tried coding in my free time. This made me realise that my true passion is programming. However, it was difficult to make the decision about switching a career. The pandemic helped me to put my life into perspective and make the move towards the career of my dreams.</p>
<p>I would love to work for a company that has software as a main product, as this way I will know that </p>
<p>I love bugs and solving them - I get very excited about searching where they are coming from! I enjoy working as a part of a team and my own. I am a self-starter, quick learner and have a can-do attitude. I am self-organised, self-motivated and love learning and improving my skills.</p>

<h2>Skills üßê</h2>

<h3>Great communicator</h3>
I have experience working with internal/external stakeholders and building strong relationships with them. In my previous roles as an SEO Manager, I was collaborating with internal teams daily to know their requirements and agree on new implementations. 

<h3>Inspiring Mentor</h3>
As a part of several of my previous roles I was responsible training and helping junior members of the team learn more. In my last role as an SEO Manager I was in charge of a team of two, whom I was training, providing support in daily tasks & organising meetings where each of the members was doing a presentation on a given topic. This helped me inspire everyone in my team to keep learning and educating themselves.</br>
After I left my team to persuade my goals in programming career, one of the juniors contacted me saying she misses me and that I was a good manager.

<h3>Fast Learner</h3>
For our final project at Makers, we decided to use a framework we were not familiar with at the time - Ruby on Rails. As we had only 2 weeks to build the project, it was essential that I learn how to build web apps with Rails in a matter of very short time. I started with reading the official documentation, along with watching video tutorials. After spending one day on studying, I was comfortable to start building the app. As a result we  successfully built a fully functioning app - <a href="https://github.com/IrinaVi/SpotiFive">SpotiFive</a>.

<h3>Team player</h3>
I love working in a team, and learning about people more through the team projects. During the Makers bootcamp I was a part of three different teams. I always try to make sure I do my part not only from the coding percpective, but also a colleague perspective: I want to make sure everyone is comfortable in the team. For example, in one of our projects, I noticed that one of the team members was very quite and didn't participate much in the team meetings. I asked the team to make sure that everyone is following and that everyone's opinions matter and they should not be shy in expressing it. After that I noticed, my team member started saying more - they knew, we need their opinion.
