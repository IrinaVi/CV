<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I love solving real life problems and coding in my free time. Each of my projects I started with thinking about how I can impove this world and help someone to solve their worry. </p>
<p>In my previous SEO roles I was writing Python scripts to automate data gathering and data analysis. I also tried coding in my free time. This made me realise that my true passion is programming. However, it was difficult to make the decision about switching a career. The pandemic helped me to put my life into perspective and make the move towards the career of my dreams.</p>
<p>I love bugs and solving them - I get very excited about searching where they are coming from! I enjoy working as a part of a team and my own. I am a self-starter, quick learner and have a can-do attitude. I am self-organised, self-motivated and love learning and improving my skills.</p>
